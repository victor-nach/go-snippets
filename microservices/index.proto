// A proto file defines a service
// for each service in our microservices architecture we have a .proto file that defines the rpc calls that service exposes
// more like the api endpoints available

syntax = "proto3";

// under the service block in the proto file we define the different rpc calls or methods we wish to expose
// the different calls request and respond with some form of data that we also have to define in the .proto file
service ServiceName {
    rpc sampleRpcCall(sampleRequest) returns (sampleResponse) {}
}

// we still have to define what sampleRequest and sampleResponse means
// the message types in the proto file are like our data structure, you can also have custom types
